# Wine-Watch
Paulina and I are attempting to make an Android Wear app.  Tap your watch every time you take a drink, and it'll start to buzz when you reach your BAC limit.

If you would like to support this project, you can do one of the following:
-Hire one of us
-Purchase us an Android phone/tablet and/or an Android watch for testing
-Purchase us an iMac, Apple Watch, and an Apple developer account so we can make an iOS version
-Donate via Venmo or Squarecash, pm me for details
